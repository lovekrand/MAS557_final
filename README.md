Group2, Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Sungjong Lee, Jingu Hwang, 

We modified the Multi-wavelet Operator and designated it as Self-Adaptive Multiwavelet Operator. 
More experiment details are provided in the main.ipynb file.

### Requirements
The code package is developed using Python 3.9 and Pytorch 2.2 with cuda 12.3. For running the experiments first install the required packages using 'requirements.txt'

## Experiments
### Data
KdV :A sample generated dataset for KdV is uploaded at [KdV data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--KYHPjl-pkrrGRtH8eg0aG7q8hUjiKg).

Burgers: For the experiments on Burgers, the code package uses the datasets as provided in the following repository by the Authors Zongyi Li et al.
